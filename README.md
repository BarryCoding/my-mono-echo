# Echo

## Echo Intro

In this video, we're building an AI-powered **customer support platform** from scratch.

You'll set up real-time AI chat with Convex Agents.  
Add voice support with VAPI.  
Upload docs and build a knowledge base with embeddings and RAG.  
Teach the AI how to escalate to a human or auto-resolve a conversation.

We'll build workspaces, teams, authentication, and billing with Clerk.  
You'll learn how to embed the chat widget, store API keys with AWS, and track errors with Sentry. Every chapter ends with a pull request and a CodeRabbit review.

This isn't just a demo. It's a full-stack, production-ready B2B SaaS template. Let's build Echo 🚀.
